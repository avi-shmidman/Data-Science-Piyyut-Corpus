# Data-Science-Piyyut-Corpus
Corpus of vocalized and morphologically-tagged Hebrew poetry from late antiquity and the middle ages, made possible by Israel Science Foundation grant 2617/22 (PI: Dr. Avi Shmidman), for the purpose of encouraging data science exploration of medieval Hebrew poetry.


Notes:

- This is a work in progress; the corpora are currently undergoing proofreading and correction. Future updates to this site will include TEI metadata as well.

- Lines which being with two pound signs (##) are header or separator lines and not part of the poems themselves

- An asterisk is used to indicate lines that are fragmentary (or completely missing), so that data analysis scripts can choose to skip those lines if relevant.

- For the most part, the corpora are contiguous, with asterisks marking any missing words or lines. In the case of Yannai, because many parts of Yannai's oeuvre are attested in a very fragmentary manner, and because the main purpose of this corpus is for stylometric data analysis, and because we wanted to make sure we had a substantial amount of Yannai data for analysis before moving forward, we have for now skipped the particularly fragmentary lines of Yannai's poetry, so that the analysis can focus upon the stylometric features present within the extant consecutive word sequences. Thus the Yannai corpus should not be considered contiguous at this point.
